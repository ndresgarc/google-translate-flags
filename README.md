Web Extension to add flag icons to Google Translate language selection

## Disclaimer

I'm aware that using flag icons to denote languages is not a good practice as many languages are spoken in several countries. As this articles point out:
+ https://wplang.org/never-use-flags-language-selection/
+ https://localizejs.com/articles/why-using-flag-icons-can-confuse-your-users/
+ http://www.flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/why-flags-do-not-represent-language/

However, I consider that using them in a big selection menu with a lot of items improves user experience noticeably.

## Build

Compile LESS into CSS by using NPM

```
npm run less
```

## Changelog
